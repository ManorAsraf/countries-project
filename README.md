# Tourism Attractiveness Comparison Between Countries

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze a variety of datasets containing information about countries around the world in order to evaluate which countries are more attractive for tourism and which are less attractive.  
The scoring system is fully objective; however, the weights assigned to each category can be adjusted based on traveler preferences, which dynamically impacts the final ranking.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is based on datasets collected from various open data sources, including:
- **countries data**
- **Happiness Index**
- **Crime Index**
- **Cost of Living data**
- **Weather conditions**
- **UNESCO World Heritage Sites**
- **Nature reserve precentage**
- **Number of tourists each year**

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- **SQL Scripts** â€“ Data integration, scoring table creation, analysis queries.  
- **Excel Files (CSV)** â€“ Data cleaning and preparation before SQL import, Final Countries Scoreboard. 
- **Presentation (PDF)** â€“ Final results, key insights, and top-ranked countries.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** â€“ Querying, scoring table creation, data analysis.  
- **Excel** â€“ Data cleaning and preparation before SQL import, Assigning weights and building the personal score, Visualization of results.
- **PowerPoint** â€“ Building a presentation.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Countries with **high accessibility**, **low cost of living**, and **balanced weather** tend to rank highest.  
- Low crime rates and significant natural reserves improve tourism attractiveness.  
- Rankings are flexible â€” adjusting factor weights changes the final order.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Full ranking and scoring breakdown are available in the **presentation (PDF)**.
- Weight customization allows dynamic ranking adjustments.

- A flexible scoring model was created, allowing travelers to customize category weights and see how the country ranking changes accordingly.
- Several countries consistently scored high across most indicators (e.g., safety, happiness, natural beauty).
- Visualizations were created to compare countries by both total score and individual category performance.
